Studies written for Sierra Chart


### List of Studies

- `bom_patterns.cpp`: Highlights two bar BOM (Breakout Mode) price patterns - ii, io, oi, OO - as seen in Al Brooks Price Action course. These patterns often precede significant price movements, such as breakouts and reversals.
- `das_pivots.cpp`: Implements a Camarilla Pivots study based on DAS Trader's Camarilla Equation. Includes Daily study and Variable Period study.
- `outside_patterns.cpp`: Highlights price patterns where the High-Low range of a set of consecutive bars extends beyond or equals the High-Low range of the prior set of bars. This can be useful for identifying momentum, potential trend reversals, or continuation signals. Personally, I like to use around a 1 to 3 ratio of Outside to Inside bars (1:3, 2:5, 3:9, 4:12, 5:15).
- `pb_pivot_extensions.cpp`: Implements PivotBoss' Pivot Extension study. Includes Daily study and Variable Period study.

### Will Add Soon...

- `equalized_risk_per_trade.cpp`: Calculates the optimal number of shares for an Equity trade based predefined risk amount per trade and current stop loss placement. This facilitates risk management by ensuring consistent risk exposure across trades.
- `moving_average_clouds.cpp`: Implements a moving average clouds indicator based on three moving averages. This can be useful for quickly identifying market trends, support and resistance, and volatility measurement.
